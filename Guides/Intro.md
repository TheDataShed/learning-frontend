# Intro

Welcome to learning frontend!

We're going to cover everything you need to build you own website, reinforce existing skills and start using JavaScript on the web.

Before we get started I'm going to just explain and few things about how the web's made up.

### HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
This is the structure of a web page, defines its content.

### CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
As it says in the title this adds styles a web page making it look nicer.
There are existing styles that come along with using some HTML elements, so adding CSS lets you add/remove additional styles.

### JavaScript
This is used for some interactivity, getting data/information from other places and so much more on the modern web!
(Some interactivity you also get from HTML elements by default)


You should always start writing/thinking about how you structure a website in HTML then CSS and finally adding Javascript where required.

There is a really nice pyramid diagram visualising this [here](https://cms.sonniesedge.net/f/styles/900/public/slides/pyramid-of-robustness.jpg?itok=tcFqqjyn).
